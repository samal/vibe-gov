Project Title: "LineageNexus" - A Scalable Data Governance and Lineage Platform

1. Executive Summary
The objective is to architect and develop LineageNexus, a highly scalable, enterprise-grade Node.js application for end-to-end data governance and lineage tracking. The platform will serve as a central source of truth for an organization's data assets, providing a clear, visual map of the data journey across disparate systems. It will empower data stewards, analysts, and compliance officers by offering detailed insights into data provenance, transformation history, and usage, while enforcing rigorous security and privacy controls.

2. Core Architecture & Technology Stack
Architectural Pattern: Employ a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of services (e.g., Connectors Service, Metadata Ingestion Service, Lineage API, Governance Engine, Web UI Service).

Primary Language/Framework: Node.js with TypeScript for backend services to ensure type safety and maintainability. Utilize a high-performance framework like Fastify or NestJS.

Metadata Storage: Use Neo4j or another graph database to store and query complex lineage relationships efficiently. Use PostgreSQL for relational metadata, user roles, and audit logs.

Messaging/Queueing: Implement RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring reliable ingestion of metadata from various sources.

Containerization: All services must be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management.

3. Key Features & Modules
3.1. Universal Connector Framework
Develop a plug-and-play connector framework to integrate with a wide range of data systems.

Initial Connectors Must Support:

Relational Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.

Data Warehouses: Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift.

NoSQL Databases: MongoDB.

Streaming Platforms: Apache Kafka.

BI Tools: Tableau (to track report and dashboard lineage).

Connectors should automatically scan and extract metadata, including schemas, tables, columns, views, and ETL job logs.

3.2. Data Lineage Engine
Capture column-level lineage, tracing a data field from its source system, through all transformation logic (e.g., SQL views, ETL scripts), to its final destination in reports or other databases.

The engine must parse SQL queries and transformation scripts to automatically map dependencies between data assets.

Provide a versioned history of lineage, allowing users to see how data flows have changed over time.

3.3. Data Governance & Security Module
Access Control: Implement a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Integrate with enterprise identity providers using SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0 for Single Sign-On (SSO).

Data Classification: Allow users to tag and classify data assets based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, Confidential, Public).

Data Masking: Implement dynamic data masking capabilities through a proxy service for sensitive data columns. The masking rules should be configurable based on user roles and data classifications.

Compliance & Auditing: Maintain an immutable audit log of all activities, including data access, permission changes, and metadata modifications, to support compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

3.4. Frontend & Visualization Interface (Built with React or Vue.js)
Interactive Lineage Graph: The primary UI feature must be an interactive, zoomable Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that visualizes data lineage. Users should be able to click on any node (e.g., a table or column) to see its upstream sources and downstream destinations.

Data Catalog: Provide a searchable data catalog where users can discover data assets, view their metadata, see data owners, and read business descriptions.

Dashboard & Reporting: A central dashboard should display key metrics like data asset growth, governance policy adherence, and recent data quality issues. Users should be able to generate and export reports on data lineage and compliance.

Change Impact Analysis: Enable users to select a data asset and simulate the impact of a potential change (e.g., modifying a table column) on all downstream dependencies.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: The system must be horizontally scalable to handle metadata from millions of data assets and process thousands of ingestion events per minute.

Performance: API response times for lineage queries should be under 500ms for typical requests. The lineage graph UI must render and remain interactive for graphs with over 1,000 nodes.

Reliability: The system must have a 99.9% uptime and include comprehensive logging, monitoring (using Prometheus and Grafana), and alerting.

Extensibility: The architecture should make it easy to add new connectors and governance features in the future without major refactoring.
